    <h1>Welcome to my first HTML project!</h1>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <paragraph>
        My name is Madina Amangeldina. I started a Software Development Bootcamp in JustIT. This is my first webpage, and the
        start of my web and software development journey. I hope I will enhance my skills and gain the necessary knowledge to create sophisticated
        programmes.

    <h2>Some more about me</h2>
    <paragraph>
        I worked in Logistics and Customer Service, but decided to start a tech career. I did several online courses by myself
        until I realised I need more support to guide me through the learning process.
    </paragraph>
    <h2>My interests</h2>
    <paragraph>
        I like spending my spare time reading books, solving sudoku puzzles, swimming and cooking. And I have recently started training for my first 5K!
